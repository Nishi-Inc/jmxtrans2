jmxtrans2
=========

Next version of JMXTrans, trying to merge the code of jmxtrans, embeded-jmxtrans and jmxtrans-agent.

This is work in progress and will at this point most probably fail miserably if you try to run it.

The `2` in jmxtrans2 emphasise the fact that this version will probably not be backward compatible with the current jmxtrans. If you have suggestions, it is the right moment make yourself heard.
